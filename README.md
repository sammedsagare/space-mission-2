# Visualize a Space Mission Using Virtual Reality

# CodeGalore

Our website is a cosmic voyage. It is an educational journey from geeking on space facts to being immersed in the cosmos. Here, we step into the virtual reality of being inside a futuristic spaceship! Where we can choose Earth, Moon, or Mars holograms for separate celestial object experiences.

Select Mars, and you're on a 360Â° adventure with a rover visualised on the red planet. The rover clicks photos of the planet's surface  everyday. Countless information is available of different components like rover, lander, craters, etc.

Select Earth, and you can experience the stimulated view of the Earth and various satellites orbitting us. Several information about the space bodies present here are explained in detail. A random astronomy picture gets clicked everyday here using NASAs APIs for better pictorial informationof the space.

Select Moon, and it allows the user to experience the lunar world in 3D. Viewers can experience the Moon's surface virtually with rovers and other components available.

Get ready to launch into the universe of knowledge and exploration!
